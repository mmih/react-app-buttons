Hi Milko,

Job done üëç, I really like the way you've combine boolean variables and components, it is written with best practice! Excellent!

The only thing that I can see that can be improved is the way you invoke the function.
As the way you did it, everytime you create new function and after execution it is destroyed, which can lead to performance issue in large app.
I can suggest you to call the function and base on the data-attributes to choose what to place.

See this example:

    changeImage(event) {
        this.setState({imageUrl: event.target.getAttribute('data-image-url')})
    }
    
    <Button name="Image One" imageChangeHandler={this.changeImage} imageUrl="https://img.rasset.ie/0010809f-500.jpg"/>
    
    const Button = ({ name, imageChangeHandler, imageUrl }) => {
      return (
          <button onClick={imageChangeHandler} data-image-url={imageUrl}>{name}</button>
      )
    }
